# Shortest Paths
**Negative cycles** are **never allowed**, otherwise there would be no "shortest path"


## Dijkstra

Shortest path from **one** node to **all** nodes

## Bellman-Ford

Shortest path from **one** node to **all** nodes, negative edges **allowed**

## Floyd-Warshall 

Shortest path between **all** pairs of vertices, negative edges **allowed**
